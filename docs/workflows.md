## Core Workflows

These are the essential workflows that define TAC's primary value.

### 1. Topic Discovery & Validation

**Agent:** Dr. Carla (Academic Advisor) + Patricia (for source validation)
**Command:** `[TD]` from Dr. Carla

**Purpose:** Help MBA students pick a viable thesis topic with source validation.

**When to Use:**
- You have no thesis topic and don't know where to start
- You have vague ideas but need to validate they're researchable
- You want to avoid picking a topic that has no academic support

**What It Does:**
1. Explores your interests in project management through conversation
2. Generates 3-4 potential topic angles based on what excites you
3. Validates each angle against USP library databases
4. Shows you actual source counts for each angle
5. Helps you select a topic with confidence

**This is THE breakthrough workflow that breaks paralysis.**
