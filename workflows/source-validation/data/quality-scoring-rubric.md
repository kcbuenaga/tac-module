# Quality Scoring Rubric

**Purpose:** Standardized framework for assessing academic source quality. Loaded by step-04 for consistent quality scoring across all sources.

**Quality Score Calculation:** 0-100% based on three weighted criteria

---

## Quality Score Components

### 1. Peer Review Status (40% of Quality Score)

**Definition:** Has the source undergone formal peer review process?

#### Scoring Rubric:

**100 points (Peer-Reviewed Journal Article)**
- Published in established peer-reviewed academic journal
- Underwent formal blind or double-blind peer review
- Editorial oversight from recognized scholars
- **Examples:** Articles in *Academy of Management Journal*, *JAMA*, *Nature*

**80 points (Peer-Reviewed Conference Proceedings)**
- Presented at academic conference with peer review
- Published in conference proceedings
- Editorial review by program committee
- **Examples:** ICIS, ACM conferences, IEEE symposiums

**60 points (Academic Book / Book Chapter)**
- Published by academic press
- Editorial review (not always peer review)
- Scholarly audience
- **Examples:** Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press

**50 points (Preprint / Working Paper)**
- Scholarly content but not yet peer-reviewed
- May be under review for journal
- Author credentials from academic institution
- **Examples:** SSRN papers, arXiv preprints, university working papers

**40 points (Thesis / Dissertation)**
- Graduate-level academic work
- Committee review (similar to peer review)
- Original research
- **Examples:** PhD dissertations, master's theses

**30 points (Grey Literature - Professional)**
- Professional reports, white papers
- Industry or government publications
- Editorial oversight but not academic peer review
- **Examples:** McKinsey reports, WHO guidelines, government reports

**20 points (Grey Literature - Other)**
- Blog posts by credentialed experts

- Questionable credibility
- **Use with caution**

#### How to Assess:

1. **Check journal website** for peer review policy
2. **Look for "peer-reviewed" designation** in database
3. **Verify journal legitimacy** (not predatory publisher)
4. **Check publication type** (article, conference, book, report)

**Red Flags (Predatory Journals):**
- Pay-to-publish model with no peer review
- Promises rapid publication (days to weeks)
- Mimics legitimate journal names
- No clear editorial board
- Excessive spam emails soliciting submissions

**Tool to Check:** Beall's List (archived), Think Check Submit, DOAJ for open-access journals

### 3. Citation Metrics (25% of Quality Score)

**Definition:** How often has this source been cited by other scholars?

#### Scoring Rubric:

**Citation counts are adjusted by publication age** - recent articles have less time to accumulate citations.

**For Articles Published 5+ Years Ago:**

- **100 points:** 100+ citations (highly influential)
- **90 points:** 50-99 citations (strong impact)
- **75 points:** 20-49 citations (solid impact)
- **60 points:** 10-19 citations (moderate impact)
- **40 points:** 5-9 citations (emerging impact)
- **20 points:** 1-4 citations (limited impact)
- **10 points:** 0 citations (not yet cited)

**For Articles Published 2-5 Years Ago:**

- **100 points:** 50+ citations (exceptional for age)
- **90 points:** 25-49 citations (very strong)
- **75 points:** 10-24 citations (strong)
- **60 points:** 5-9 citations (solid)
- **40 points:** 2-4 citations (moderate)
- **20 points:** 1 citation (emerging)
- **10 points:** 0 citations (too recent)

**For Articles Published <2 Years Ago:**

- **100 points:** 20+ citations (remarkable for age)
- **90 points:** 10-19 citations (very strong)
- **75 points:** 5-9 citations (strong)
- **60 points:** 2-4 citations (solid)
- **40 points:** 1 citation (emerging)
- **20 points:** 0 citations (too recent to assess)

**Special Cases:**

- **Books:** Typically accumulate citations more slowly - use lower thresholds
- **Seminal/Classic Works:** May have 1000+ citations (cap at 100 points)
- **Highly Specialized Topics:** Lower citation counts expected (adjust expectations)
- **Recent Preprints:** 0 citations acceptable if content is cutting-edge

#### How to Assess:

1. **Google Scholar:**
   - Search for article title in quotes
   - "Cited by X" shows citation count
   - Click "Cited by" to see who cited it

2. **Web of Science:**
   - "Times Cited" shows citation count
   - Filter to see only citations from high-quality journals

3. **Scopus:**
   - "Cited by" shows citation count
   - Similar to Web of Science

**Citation Context Matters:**
- High citations from top journals = stronger indicator
- High citations from predatory journals = less meaningful
- Check if highly cited because it's foundational vs. controversial

## Calculating Final Quality Score

**Formula:**

```
Quality Score = (Peer Review Score × 0.40) + (Journal Tier Score × 0.35) + (Citation Score × 0.25)
```

**Example Calculation:**

**Source:** "Agile Implementation in Healthcare: A Systematic Review"
- Published in *BMJ Open* (peer-reviewed journal)
- Journal Tier: Q1 (Scimago)
- Published 3 years ago with 15 citations

**Scoring:**
1. **Peer Review:** 100 points (peer-reviewed journal) × 0.40 = 40
2. **Journal Tier:** 75 points (Tier 2 journal) × 0.35 = 26.25
3. **Citations:** 75 points (10-24 citations, 2-5 years old) × 0.25 = 18.75

**Final Quality Score:** 40 + 26.25 + 18.75 = **85%**

## Special Considerations

### Non-Traditional Sources

**When Grey Literature is Acceptable:**
- Government reports (WHO, CDC, NIH guidelines)
- Industry standards (ISO, IEEE)
- Reputable think tanks (McKinsey, Brookings Institution)
- NGO reports (World Bank, UN agencies)

**Quality Assessment:**
- Evaluate author credentials and institutional affiliation
- Check citation count in academic literature
- Verify independence and methodology
- Note limitations in your literature review

### Non-English Sources

**Quality indicators remain the same:**
- Peer review status
- Journal reputation (regional or international)
- Citation metrics

**Additional checks:**
- Verify journal indexed in international databases
- Check Scimago for non-English journals
- Evaluate translation quality if using translated version

### Open Access Considerations

**Open Access ≠ Low Quality**
- Many top journals offer open access options (hybrid model)
- Some journals are fully open access and high quality (*PLOS ONE*, *BMJ Open*)
- Check: Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)

**Predatory Open Access:**
- Pay-to-publish with no peer review
- Promises fast publication
- Mimics legitimate journal names
- **Check:** Think Check Submit guidelines

## Patricia's Quality Assessment Tips

💡 **When in Doubt, Verify:**
- Cross-check journal in Scimago and DOAJ
- Ask your advisor about unfamiliar journals
- Check if journal is indexed in Web of Science or Scopus

💡 **Balance Quality with Relevance:**
- A highly relevant Tier 2 article (Quality 75%) may be more valuable than a tangentially related Tier 1 article (Quality 95%)
- **Source Validation uses dual scoring for this reason**

💡 **Use Quality Trends:**
- If most sources in your field are Quality 70-80%, that's your baseline
- One 95% source among many 60% sources suggests gap in literature
- All 50% sources suggests topic may be too niche or emerging

💡 **Citation Context:**
- Check WHO is citing (top scholars vs. unknown authors)
- Check WHERE cited (discussion/background vs. central argument)
- High citations alone don't guarantee quality

💡 **Publication Date Matters:**
- Recent sources (<5 years) show current state of field
- Classic sources (10+ years, highly cited) show foundational knowledge
- Balance both in literature review
