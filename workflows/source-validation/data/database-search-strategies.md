# Database Search Strategies

**Purpose:** Educational reference for academic database searching best practices. Used by Patricia to guide students through effective source discovery.

## Core Search Principles

### 1. Boolean Operators

**AND** - Narrows results (both terms must appear)
- Example: `agile AND healthcare`
- Use when: Too many irrelevant results

**OR** - Broadens results (either term can appear)
- Example: `agile OR scrum OR kanban`
- Use when: Synonyms or related concepts exist

**NOT** - Excludes terms
- Example: `agile NOT software`
- Use when: Common term has multiple meanings

**Combining Operators:**
- Use parentheses for complex queries
- Example: `(agile OR scrum) AND healthcare NOT software`

### 2. Phrase Searching

**Exact Phrases** - Use quotation marks
- Example: `"digital transformation"`
- Ensures words appear together in that exact order

**Proximity Operators** (database-specific)
- NEAR/5: Words within 5 words of each other
- Example: `agile NEAR/5 methodology`

### 3. Truncation and Wildcards

**Truncation (*)** - Finds word variations
- Example: `manag*` finds manage, manager, management, managing
- Use when: Multiple word forms exist

**Wildcards (?)** - Replaces single character
- Example: `wom?n` finds woman, women
- Use when: Spelling variations exist (American vs British)

## Search Strategy by Research Stage

### Stage 1: Exploratory (Broad)

**Goal:** Understand the landscape of your topic

**Strategy:**
- Start with Google Scholar for comprehensive overview
- Use broad keywords (1-2 terms)
- Review abstracts to identify key concepts and authors

**Example:**
- Topic: "Agile in Healthcare"
- Search: `agile healthcare` OR `"agile methodology" hospital`

### Stage 2: Focused (Targeted)

**Goal:** Find specific literature on narrowed topic

**Strategy:**
- Use 3-4 specific keywords with Boolean operators
- Filter by publication date (recent 5-10 years)
- Target specific databases (JSTOR for foundational, WoS for recent)

**Example:**
- Narrowed: "Agile implementation in hospital emergency departments"
- Search: `(agile OR scrum) AND hospital AND ("emergency department" OR "emergency room")`

### Stage 3: Comprehensive (Exhaustive)

**Goal:** Ensure no major sources missed

**Strategy:**
- Search all 5 databases
- Use citation chaining (forward and backward)
- Check references of key articles
- Include grey literature (theses, reports)

**Example:**
- Add: `AND (implementation OR adoption OR transformation)`
- Check: Citations in top 3 most relevant articles

## Common Search Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Too Many Results (>1000)

**Solutions:**
1. Add more specific keywords
2. Use "AND" to narrow
3. Filter by recent publication dates
4. Limit to peer-reviewed journals only

**Example:**
- Before: `leadership` (500,000 results)
- After: `"transformational leadership" AND "organizational change" AND healthcare` (800 results)

### Challenge: Too Few Results (<5)

**Solutions:**
1. Remove overly specific keywords
2. Use "OR" for synonyms
3. Expand date range
4. Use truncation for word variations
5. Remove language filters

**Example:**
- Before: `"agile scrum implementation" AND "pediatric emergency departments" AND Brazil` (0 results)
- After: `(agile OR scrum) AND (hospital OR healthcare) AND (implementation OR adoption)` (120 results)

### Challenge: Irrelevant Results

**Solutions:**
1. Use "NOT" to exclude unwanted contexts
2. Use exact phrase searching with quotes
3. Search in "Title" or "Abstract" fields only (not full text)
4. Add discipline-specific terms

**Example:**
- Before: `agile` (includes software development, manufacturing, etc.)
- After: `agile AND healthcare NOT software NOT manufacturing` (relevant results)

### Challenge: Paywalled Articles

**Solutions:**
1. Check Google Scholar for open-access versions
2. Use institutional access (CAPES Periódicos)
3. Request via ResearchGate or author email
4. Check university library's interlibrary loan
5. Use SciELO for open-access alternatives

## Quality Indicators While Searching

### Green Flags (High Quality)

✅ **Peer-reviewed journals**
✅ **High citation counts** (relative to publication date)
✅ **Reputable publishers** (Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, etc.)
✅ **Recent publication** (within 5 years for most fields)
✅ **Clear methodology** (visible in abstract)
✅ **Institutional affiliations** for authors

### Red Flags (Proceed with Caution)

⚠️ **Predatory journals** (pay-to-publish, no peer review)
⚠️ **No author affiliations** or credentials
⚠️ **No citations** (for articles >2 years old)
⚠️ **Vague methodology**
⚠️ **Overly promotional language** in abstract
⚠️ **Not peer-reviewed** (unless intentionally seeking grey literature)

## Advanced Techniques

### Citation Chaining

**Backward Chaining:**
- Review references in relevant articles
- Identify foundational/seminal works

**Forward Chaining:**
- Use "Cited by" in Google Scholar or Web of Science
- Find recent articles building on important earlier work

### Author Tracking

**Strategy:**
- Identify 2-3 key authors in your field
- Search for all their publications
- Check their recent work (last 2 years)

**Tools:**
- Google Scholar author profiles
- ORCID IDs
- ResearchGate profiles

### Journal Mining

**Strategy:**
- Identify 3-5 top journals in your specific field
- Browse recent issues (table of contents)
- Set up alerts for new publications

**Example Journals by Field:**
- Healthcare Management: *Health Affairs*, *BMJ*, *JAMA*
- Business/Management: *Harvard Business Review*, *Academy of Management Journal*
- Technology: *MIS Quarterly*, *Information Systems Research*

## Search Documentation (For Thesis/Dissertation)

**Record the Following:**
- Databases searched (which ones, when)
- Keywords used (exact search strings)
- Filters applied (date range, language, peer-review)
- Results count per search
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria

**Why This Matters:**
- Demonstrates systematic literature review
- Enables replication
- Required for many thesis methodologies
- Shows academic rigor

**Template:**
```
Database: JSTOR
Date Searched: 2026-01-25
Search String: ("agile methodology" OR scrum) AND healthcare AND implementation
Filters: 2015-2025, English, Peer-reviewed journals
Results: 87 articles
After screening: 12 relevant sources
```

## Tips for Non-Native English Speakers

### Strategy 1: Bilingual Searching

- Search in Portuguese/Spanish first to understand concepts
- Translate key terms to English for broader searches
- Use SciELO for Portuguese/Spanish sources
- Include English sources for global perspective

### Strategy 2: Language Support Tools

- Use Google Translate for abstracts (not for critical analysis)
- Keep abstracts in original language when possible
- DeepL for higher-quality translations
- Dictionary of academic terms in both languages

### Strategy 3: Multilingual Keywords

- Include both English and Portuguese terms with OR
- Example: `"gestão ágil" OR "agile management"`
- Capture sources from both academic communities

## Patricia's Pro Tips

💡 **Start Broad, Then Narrow**
- First search: Understand the landscape
- Second search: Focus on your specific angle
- Third search: Fill gaps and cite backwards

💡 **Quality Over Quantity**

- Focus on peer-reviewed, well-cited articles
- Don't force irrelevant sources just to hit a number

💡 **Use Alerts & RSS**
- Set up Google Scholar alerts for your keywords
- Follow key journals via RSS or email alerts
- Research is ongoing - stay current even after initial search

💡 **Take Notes While Searching**
- Mark sources as: Must Read, Maybe, Background Only

- Organize by theme/subtopic from the start

💡 **When in Doubt, Ask**
- University librarians are experts
- Use office hours or online chat
- Many libraries offer research consultation appointments
