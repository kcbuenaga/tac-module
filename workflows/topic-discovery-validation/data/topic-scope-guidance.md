# Topic Scope Guidance: Finding the Sweet Spot

**Purpose:** Help students and Dr. Carla recognize when a topic is too broad, too narrow, or just right.

**Usage:** Referenced in step-02 (interests exploration) and step-04 (topic angle generation).

## The Goldilocks Principle

**Too Broad** = Impossible to research comprehensively in thesis timeframe
**Too Narrow** = Not enough sources or depth for academic research
**Just Right** = Specific enough to research deeply, broad enough to have substance

---

## Signs Your Topic Is Too Broad

### Red Flag Phrases

❌ **"All of..."**
- "All of project management"
- "All agile methodologies"
- "All stakeholder management"

❌ **Vague Outcome Questions**
- "What makes projects successful?"
- "How does project management work?"
- "Why is agile important?"

❌ **Entire Methodologies or Frameworks**
- "Agile methodology"
- "Waterfall approach"
- "PMBOK Guide"

### Diagnostic Questions

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Could this be a textbook?**
   - If yes → Too broad
   - Example: "Project Management" = entire textbook

2. **Could 5 different people research this and get completely different results?**
   - If yes → Too broad
   - Example: "Project success factors" (which industry? which methodology? which success metrics?)

3. **Would this take 5+ years to research comprehensively?**
   - If yes → Too broad
   - Example: "Agile adoption patterns globally"

4. **Does your research question have 10+ sub-questions?**
   - If yes → Too broad
   - Example: "How does agile work?" (requires understanding ceremonies, roles, artifacts, principles, values, practices...)

### Examples of Too Broad

❌ **"Project Management in Healthcare"**
- Problem: Which aspect of PM? Which healthcare context? Which projects?
- Too many variables, impossible to cover comprehensively

❌ **"Agile vs Waterfall"**
- Problem: Entire methodologies, decades of research, countless contexts
- Would require textbook-length treatment

❌ **"Stakeholder Communication"**
- Problem: Which stakeholders? What type of communication? In what context?
- Every project has different stakeholders and communication needs

❌ **"Risk Management Effectiveness"**
- Problem: Which risks? Which management techniques? In what context?
- "Effectiveness" by what metrics?

### How to Narrow Too-Broad Topics

**Strategy 1: Add Specificity**
- "Project Management" → "Risk Management"
- "Risk Management" → "Risk Identification Techniques"
- "Risk Identification Techniques" → "Risk Identification Techniques in Construction Projects"

**Strategy 2: Focus on One Aspect**
- "Agile Methodology" → "Scrum Retrospectives"
- "Scrum" → "One Scrum Ceremony or Practice"
- "Scrum Retrospectives" → "Retrospective Facilitation Techniques"

**Strategy 3: Add Context**
- "Stakeholder Management" → "Stakeholder Management in Government Projects"
- "Agile Adoption" → "Agile Adoption in Brazilian Banks"
- "Project Success" → "Success Metrics in IT Projects vs Construction Projects"

**Strategy 4: Focus on a Problem or Question**
- "Project Communication" → "Why do some teams have effective standups and others don't?"
- "Agile Transformation" → "What barriers prevent agile adoption in traditional organizations?"

## Signs Your Topic Is Too Narrow

### Red Flag Phrases

❌ **Single Tool/Software**
- "How Jira's sprint board works"
- "Asana vs Monday.com feature comparison"

❌ **One Company/One Project**
- "How Company X manages projects"
- "The project management process at ABC Corp"
- Exception: Case study as part of broader research question

❌ **Trivial Details**
- "The ideal length of a standup meeting"
- "Color schemes in Kanban boards"
- "Font sizes in project documentation"

❌ **Binary Yes/No Questions**
- "Do standups improve communication?" (yes, next question?)
- "Is agile better than waterfall?" (depends on context, next question?)

### Diagnostic Questions

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Can this be answered with a single source?**
   - If yes → Too narrow
   - Example: "What are the five Scrum values?" (defined in Scrum Guide, done)

2. **Is this just describing how one tool/framework works?**
   - If yes → Too narrow (unless comparing to theory or practice)
   - Example: "How Jira tracks sprints" (documentation, not research)

3. **Would this be a blog post, not a research paper?**
   - If yes → Too narrow
   - Example: "5 tips for better standups"

4. **Is there only one right answer?**
   - If yes → Too narrow
   - Example: "What is the definition of a sprint?" (defined term, not debatable)

### Examples of Too Narrow

❌ **"Jira's Sprint Board Features"**
- Problem: Tool documentation, not academic research
- No theoretical contribution or empirical investigation

❌ **"The Ideal Standup Meeting Duration"**
- Problem: Trivial detail, varies by context
- Not enough depth for thesis

❌ **"One Company's Scrum Implementation"**
- Problem: Single case, limited generalizability
- Better as: "Patterns in Scrum implementation across 10 Brazilian companies"

❌ **"Comparing Two Project Management Tools"**
- Problem: Tool features change constantly, not academic contribution
- Better as: "How tool selection affects team collaboration patterns"

### How to Broaden Too-Narrow Topics

**Strategy 1: Ask "Why" or "How"**
- "Standup meetings" → "Why do standups work in some teams and fail in others?"
- "Retrospectives" → "How do teams adapt retrospectives to their culture?"

**Strategy 2: Add Comparison or Context**
- "One company's process" → "Patterns across 10 companies"
- "Tool features" → "How tool choice affects collaboration"

**Strategy 3: Connect to Theory or Outcomes**
- "Sprint planning" → "How sprint planning quality affects sprint outcomes"
- "Kanban boards" → "How visualization techniques affect team cognitive load"

**Strategy 4: Look at the Bigger Question**
- "Jira vs Asana" → "What factors should teams consider when selecting PM tools?"
- "Standup format" → "What makes team synchronization effective in agile teams?"

### The "Scope Checklist"

**Before finalizing your topic, check:**

- [ ] Can I clearly state my research question in 1-2 sentences?
- [ ] Can I explain what's IN scope and OUT of scope?
- [ ] Can I realistically research this in 3-6 months?
- [ ] Are there 15-30 academic sources available? (validated in step-06)
- [ ] Is my question more complex than a yes/no answer?
- [ ] Does this question have depth (multiple dimensions to explore)?
- [ ] Would two different researchers approach this similarly (not too vague)?
- [ ] Is this more than a tool comparison or process description?

If you answered "yes" to all → Your scope is probably right!

## Adjusting Scope: The Scope Lever

**Think of scope as a lever you can slide:**

```
[Too Narrow] ←――――――――――― [Sweet Spot] ―――――――――――→ [Too Broad]
```

**Narrowing Levers:**
1. **Context** - Add industry, geography, company size
2. **Methodology** - Focus on one methodology (Scrum not all Agile)
3. **Phase** - Focus on one project phase (initiation, execution, closure)
4. **Stakeholder** - Focus on one stakeholder type (customers, not all stakeholders)
5. **Problem** - Focus on one specific problem or challenge

**Broadening Levers:**
1. **Remove context** - Multiple industries instead of one
2. **Compare** - Two contexts, two methods, before/after
3. **Expand phase** - Multiple project phases
4. **Add stakeholders** - Multiple stakeholder perspectives
5. **Generalize** - Patterns across cases instead of single case

## Common Scope Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: "I Want to Cover Everything"

**Symptom:** "I'm interested in agile, so I'll research all of agile"

**Why it fails:** Too broad, can't go deep, superficial treatment

**Fix:** Pick one aspect that genuinely excites you
- Not "agile" → "Scrum retrospectives"
- Not "project success" → "Success factors in IT projects vs construction projects"

### Pitfall 2: "I Want to Study My Own Company"

**Symptom:** "I'll research how my company does project management"

**Why it fails:** Too narrow, limited generalizability, bias

**Fix:** Expand to patterns across multiple companies
- Not "Company X" → "Patterns in 5-10 companies"
- Not "our process" → "How companies in [industry] approach [problem]"

### Pitfall 3: "This Seems Too Specific"

**Symptom:** Student worries their focused topic is too narrow

**Why it happens:** Confusing specificity with narrowness

**Fix:** Specific is good! Check depth, not breadth
- "Scrum retrospectives" = specific, but deep (facilitation, adaptation, outcomes, cultural factors)
- "One retrospective format" = specific AND narrow (not enough depth)

### Pitfall 4: "I Can't Decide Between 3 Topics, So I'll Do All of Them"

**Symptom:** Research question has "and" repeated 3+ times

**Why it fails:** Trying to do three theses in one

**Fix:** Pick one, save others for future research
- Not "Risk AND stakeholders AND agile adoption"
- Choose: "Risk identification in agile projects" OR "Stakeholder engagement in agile adoption"

## For Dr. Carla: Scope Check Questions

**When students present topic ideas, ask:**

**If topic seems too broad:**
- "That's a fascinating area! What specific aspect interests you most?"
- "If you had to pick one piece of [broad topic] to really understand, what would it be?"
- "What's the real question you're trying to answer about [topic]?"

**If topic seems too narrow:**
- "That's very specific! What's the bigger question you're exploring?"
- "Why is [narrow topic] interesting - what does it tell us about something larger?"
- "Could you expand this to compare a few cases or contexts?"

**If topic is well-scoped:**
- "Great scope! You can explain what's in and out clearly."
- "This is specific enough to research deeply but broad enough to have substance."
- "You'll be able to find sources and complete this in your timeframe."

---

## For Students: Trust the Process

**Remember:**
- Scope emerges through exploration (step-02) and angle generation (step-04)
- Source validation (step-06) will confirm your scope is researchable
- Specific topics often feel "too narrow" at first but have surprising depth
- You can adjust scope after validation if needed

**The goal:** A topic that excites you and is feasible to research. Not too big to finish, not too small to matter.

**When in doubt:** Ask "Can I research this deeply in 3-6 months?" If yes → probably good scope!
