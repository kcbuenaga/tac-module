# Source Quality Criteria for Academic Research

**Purpose:** Guide assessment of academic source quality during topic validation and literature review.

**Usage:** Referenced in step-06 (library validation) when Patricia assesses source quality.

---

## Quality Assessment Framework

**Good academic sources have:**
1. **Authority** - Expert authors, reputable publishers
2. **Peer Review** - Validated by other experts
3. **Currency** - Recent and relevant to current context
4. **Relevance** - Directly addresses your research question
5. **Objectivity** - Balanced, evidence-based, transparent methods

## Currency: How Recent Should Sources Be?

### By Topic Type

**Fast-Moving Topics (Last 5 Years Preferred):**
- Agile/Scrum methodologies
- Digital transformation
- Remote work and distributed teams
- AI/ML in project management
- DevOps and continuous delivery

**Moderate Topics (Last 10 Years Acceptable):**
- Stakeholder management
- Risk management
- Most project management topics
- Leadership and teams
- Organizational factors

**Foundational Topics (Older Sources Acceptable):**
- Project management history
- Classic theories (Critical Path Method, PERT)
- Seminal works (frequently cited in recent research)

### Mixing Old and New

**Good Literature Reviews Include:**
- **Foundational works** - Seminal papers that established the field
- **Recent research** - Last 5 years to show current state
- **Progression** - How understanding evolved over time

**Red Flags:**
- All sources >10 years old (suggests stale topic)
- No seminal works (suggests shallow understanding)
- Only very recent sources (suggests no historical context)

---

## Relevance: Does It Match Your Topic?

### Direct Relevance (Tier 1)

**Criteria:**
- Research question closely matches yours
- Same context (industry, geography, methodology)
- Directly informs your research

**Example:**
Your topic: "Scrum retrospective adaptations in Brazilian software teams"
Direct source: "Agile practices in Latin American software companies"

### Partial Relevance (Tier 2)

**Criteria:**
- One or two key concepts match
- Different context but transferable insights
- Theoretical foundation for your work

**Example:**
Your topic: "Scrum retrospective adaptations in Brazilian software teams"
Partial source: "Team reflection practices in agile teams" (no Brazil context, but relevant practice)

### Tangential Relevance (Tier 3)

**Criteria:**
- Broadly related to your topic
- Provides context or background
- May inform one small aspect

**Example:**
Your topic: "Scrum retrospective adaptations in Brazilian software teams"
Tangential: "Organizational culture in Brazil" (context, not directly about retrospectives)

### Not Relevant (Exclude)

**Criteria:**
- Different topic entirely
- Only shares a keyword but different meaning
- Not applicable to your research

## Authority: Who Wrote This?

### Author Credentials

**Look For:**
- **PhD in relevant field** - Shows expert training

**Red Flags:**
- No author credentials listed
- Author is vendor/company (bias)
- No academic or professional affiliation

### Publisher Credibility

✅ **Acceptable:**
- Minor funding from industry (disclosed)
- Clear scope limitations
- Balanced perspective

### Signs of Bias

❌ **Red Flags:**
- Marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- No limitations discussed (every study has limitations)
- Cherry-picked data
- Funded by vendor without disclosure
- Sweeping claims without evidence

## Patricia's Quality Assessment Protocol

**When assessing sources in step-06:**

### Count Only Quality Sources

**Include in Count:**
- Tier 1: Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Tier 2: Top conference proceedings
- Tier 3: Academic books/chapters (university presses)
- Tier 4: PhD dissertations

**Exclude from Count:**
- Blog posts, news articles
- Marketing white papers
- Non-peer-reviewed content
- Vendor-biased reports

### Quality Rating System

**GOOD (20+ sources):**
- Mostly Tier 1-2 sources
- Recent (majority from last 10 years)
- Highly relevant (Tier 1 relevance)
- Mix of foundational and current research

**MODERATE (10-20 sources):**
- Mix of Tier 1-4 sources
- Some older sources (10-15 years)
- Mostly relevant (Tier 1-2 relevance)
- May require broader searching

**LIMITED (<10 sources):**
- Few Tier 1-2 sources
- Older sources or very new topic
- Tangential relevance (Tier 2-3)
- May need creative research strategies

### Sample Sources

**When providing 3-5 sample sources:**

1. **Include 1-2 Tier 1 sources** (peer-reviewed journals)
2. **Include 1-2 recent sources** (last 5 years)
3. **Include variety** (different authors, journals, perspectives)
4. **Prioritize relevance** (Tier 1 relevance first)
5. **Provide context** (1-sentence why it's relevant)

## For Students: What This Means

**When reviewing validation results:**

**"Good" Quality = Green Light**
- Strong academic interest in your topic
- Plenty of sources to build comprehensive literature review
- Choose this topic with confidence

**"Moderate" Quality = Proceed with Awareness**
- Topic is researchable but may require more effort
- Fewer sources means each one matters more
- Be prepared for creative searching strategies
- Still viable, just requires more work

**"Limited" Quality = Consider Carefully**
- Topic may be too narrow or too new
- May need to broaden scope or adjust angle
- Could work with creative approach and advisor support
- Discuss with advisor before committing

---

**Remember:** Quality matters more than quantity. 15 highly relevant, recent, peer-reviewed sources are better than 50 tangentially related or low-quality sources.
