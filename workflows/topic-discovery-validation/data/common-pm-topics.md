## How to Use These Examples

**For Students:**
- These are EXAMPLES, not requirements - your topic can be different
- Use these to spark ideas, not limit your thinking
- Notice which categories resonate with you
- Combine categories (e.g., "Agile in Construction" or "Stakeholder Management in Healthcare")

**For Dr. Carla:**
- Reference these when students say "I don't know what interests me"
- Help students see patterns in their interests (methodology, challenge, context, etc.)
- Use to validate that their interests are researchable
- Don't push students toward "popular" topics - authentic interest matters more

---

**Remember:** The best topics combine:
- Authentic student interest (what makes them curious)
- Research feasibility (sources available, scope manageable)
- Real-world relevance (addresses actual problems or questions)

These examples show what's possible, but students should choose based on what genuinely excites them.
