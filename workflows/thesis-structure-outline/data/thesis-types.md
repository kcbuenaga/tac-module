# Thesis Types Reference

**Purpose:** Reference data for different MBA thesis types and their corresponding chapter structures.

---

## 1. Empirical Research

**Description:**
Research that collects and analyzes NEW data to answer a research question. The researcher designs data collection instruments (surveys, interviews, experiments) and applies statistical or qualitative analysis methods.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Primary data collection (not existing research)
- Systematic data analysis methodology
- Results based on collected data
- Generalizable findings (depending on sample)

**Typical Chapter Structure:**
1. **Introduction** - Problem, objectives, significance
2. **Literature Review** - Theoretical foundation and prior research
3. **Methodology** - Research design, data collection, analysis methods
4. **Results** - Findings from data analysis
5. **Discussion** - Interpretation, implications, limitations
6. **Conclusion** - Summary and recommendations

**Methodology Chapter Focus:**
- Research design (quantitative/qualitative/mixed)
- Population and sampling
- Data collection instruments
- Data analysis procedures
- Validity and reliability

## 2. Case Study

**Description:**
In-depth analysis of one or more specific cases (organizations, projects, events). Uses multiple data sources to understand the case(s) in depth and context.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Focus on specific, bounded case(s)
- Multiple data sources (documents, interviews, observations)
- Rich contextual detail
- Aims for deep understanding, not generalization

**Typical Chapter Structure:**
1. **Introduction** - Research problem, case selection, significance
2. **Literature Review** - Theoretical framework for case analysis
3. **Methodology** - Case selection, data collection, analysis approach
4. **Case Description/Context** - Background of the case(s)
5. **Case Analysis** - Findings organized by themes or research questions
6. **Discussion** - Cross-case insights (if multiple cases), theoretical implications
7. **Conclusion** - Summary, lessons learned, recommendations

**Methodology Chapter Focus:**
- Case selection criteria and justification
- Data sources (interviews, documents, observations)
- Analysis approach (pattern matching, explanation building)
- Triangulation methods

## 3. Literature-Based (Theoretical)

**Description:**
Systematic analysis and synthesis of existing published research. No new data collection - the researcher works with academic literature to identify patterns, gaps, or develop theoretical frameworks.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Works with secondary sources (published research)
- Systematic literature search and selection
- Critical analysis and synthesis
- Theory development or framework proposal

**Typical Chapter Structure:**
1. **Introduction** - Research problem, objectives, scope
2. **Methodology** - Literature search strategy, selection criteria, analysis approach
3. **Thematic Literature Review** - Organized by themes or concepts
4. **Synthesis and Analysis** - Patterns, tensions, gaps identified
5. **Theoretical Framework/Model** - Proposed framework based on synthesis
6. **Conclusion** - Contributions, implications, future research

**Note:** Literature Review and Results are combined in thematic chapters.

**Methodology Chapter Focus:**
- Search strategy (databases, keywords, timeframe)
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Quality assessment of sources
- Analysis method (thematic, content analysis)

## 4. Mixed-Methods

**Description:**
Combines quantitative and qualitative research approaches in a single study. Uses both numerical data (surveys, metrics) and rich qualitative data (interviews, observations) for comprehensive understanding.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Both quantitative AND qualitative data
- Integration of findings from both methods
- Complementary insights
- More complex methodology

**Typical Chapter Structure:**
1. **Introduction** - Problem, rationale for mixed-methods
2. **Literature Review** - Theoretical foundation
3. **Methodology** - Mixed-methods design, quantitative and qualitative components
4. **Quantitative Results** - Statistical findings
5. **Qualitative Results** - Interview/observation findings
6. **Integrated Analysis** - How both methods inform the research question
7. **Discussion** - Combined interpretation
8. **Conclusion** - Summary and recommendations

**Alternative Structure:** Can combine results into one chapter with integrated analysis.

**Methodology Chapter Focus:**
- Mixed-methods design type (explanatory, exploratory, convergent)
- Quantitative component (sample, instruments, analysis)
- Qualitative component (participants, data collection, analysis)
- Integration strategy

## 5. Action Research

**Description:**
The researcher implements a change/intervention in an organization and studies its effects. Combines action (implementing change) with research (studying the process and outcomes).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Researcher actively involved in the intervention
- Cyclical process (plan-act-observe-reflect)
- Practical problem-solving focus
- Context-specific findings

**Typical Chapter Structure:**
1. **Introduction** - Problem in organizational context, action research rationale
2. **Literature Review** - Theoretical foundation for the intervention
3. **Methodology** - Action research design, intervention plan, data collection
4. **Context and Initial Situation** - Pre-intervention state
5. **Action Cycles** - Description of intervention phases and observations
6. **Results and Reflections** - Outcomes and lessons from action cycles
7. **Discussion** - Implications for practice and theory
8. **Conclusion** - Recommendations for practitioners

**Methodology Chapter Focus:**
- Action research approach and cycles
- Intervention description
- Researcher role and positioning
- Data collection during action cycles
- Reflection methods

## Selection Guide

**To choose thesis type, ask:**

1. **Will you collect NEW data?**
   - YES → Empirical, Case Study, Mixed-Methods, or Action Research
   - NO → Literature-Based

2. **If collecting new data, what kind?**
   - Quantitative (surveys, metrics) → Empirical or Mixed-Methods
   - Qualitative (interviews, observations) → Empirical, Case Study, or Action Research
   - Both → Mixed-Methods

3. **Are you studying one specific organization/project deeply?**
   - YES → Case Study

4. **Are you implementing a change in your organization?**
   - YES → Action Research

5. **Are you synthesizing existing research only?**
   - YES → Literature-Based

## Chapter Structure Flexibility

**Note:** These are TYPICAL structures, not rigid requirements. Actual chapter structure should be discussed with thesis advisor and adapted to:
- University requirements
- Program guidelines
- Specific research needs
- Advisor preferences

João will help adapt the structure based on the student's specific context.
