# Coaching Questions Reference

**Purpose:** Reference examples of coaching questions for different chapter sections to help students think through what to write.

**Usage:** João uses these as inspiration to create coaching questions contextualized to the student's specific topic.

**CRITICAL:** These are EXAMPLES only. João must adapt and contextualize every question to the student's specific research, topic, and context.

## Guidelines for João Creating Coaching Questions

**DO:**
✅ Contextualize to student's specific topic, research question, and context
✅ Ask questions that make students THINK
✅ Probe for specificity ("What SPECIFICALLY?")
✅ Connect to their research question
✅ Challenge assumptions
✅ Ask "why" and "how"
✅ Make questions actionable for writing

**DON'T:**
❌ Give generic questions that could apply to any thesis
❌ Ask yes/no questions
❌ Provide answers in the questions
❌ Write text FOR them
❌ Give templates to fill in
❌ Accept vague responses without challenge

**Question Quality Test:**
Good coaching question = Student has to THINK to answer it
Bad coaching question = Student can answer without thinking about their research

**Example - BAD (generic):**
"What is your research question?"

**Example - GOOD (contextualized):**
"What specific problem in Brazilian Agile adoption does your research question address, and why hasn't existing research answered this yet?"

The difference: The good question makes them think about their specific context, connect to the problem, and justify the research gap.
