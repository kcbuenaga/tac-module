---

### Mixed-Methods Methodologies

**Design Types:**

- Exploratory sequential (QUAL → quan to test)
- Embedded (one method nested within the other)

**Key Components:**
- Justification for mixing methods
- Quantitative component (as in empirical research)
- Qualitative component (as in empirical research)
- Integration strategy
- Priority (equal, QUAN priority, or QUAL priority)

---

### Action Research Methodologies

**Approaches:**
- Participatory action research
- Practical action research
- Classroom action research (if educational context)

**Cycles:**
- Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect → Revise Plan

**Key Components:**
- Initial situation assessment
- Intervention design
- Action cycles description
- Data collection throughout cycles
- Reflection methods
- Researcher role and positioning

## Common Research Designs

**Cross-Sectional:**
- Data collected at one point in time
- Snapshot of phenomenon
- Good for: Describing current state, relationships at one time
- Limitation: Cannot establish causality

**Longitudinal:**
- Data collected at multiple points over time
- Tracks changes
- Good for: Understanding development, trends, causal relationships
- Limitation: Time-consuming, attrition

**Experimental:**
- Manipulation of variables with control
- Random assignment
- Good for: Establishing causality
- Limitation: May not reflect real-world conditions

**Quasi-Experimental:**
- Manipulation without full control
- Non-random assignment
- Good for: Real-world settings where experiments aren't feasible
- Limitation: Less internal validity than true experiments

---

## Sampling Approaches

**Probability Sampling (Quantitative):**
- Simple random sampling
- Stratified sampling
- Cluster sampling
- Systematic sampling

**Non-Probability Sampling (Qualitative):**
- Purposive/Theoretical sampling
- Snowball sampling
- Convenience sampling
- Maximum variation sampling

**Sample Size Guidance:**
- Quantitative: Statistical power analysis, effect size considerations
- Qualitative: Saturation principle, depth over breadth
- Mixed-methods: Appropriate for each component

---

## Data Collection Instruments

**Surveys:**
- Likert scales
- Multiple choice
- Open-ended questions
- Validated instruments vs. self-developed

**Interview Guides:**
- Structured
- Semi-structured
- Unstructured
- Critical incident technique

**Observation Protocols:**
- Participant observation
- Non-participant observation
- Structured observation forms

**Document Analysis:**
- Primary sources
- Secondary sources
- Coding frameworks

---

## Data Analysis Approaches

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, frequency)
- Inferential statistics (t-test, ANOVA, regression)
- Factor analysis
- Structural equation modeling
- Software: SPSS, R, Stata, Excel

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Thematic analysis
- Content analysis
- Grounded theory coding
- Narrative analysis
- Discourse analysis
- Software: NVivo, Atlas.ti, MAXQDA, manual coding

**Mixed Methods Integration:**
- Data transformation (quantitizing or qualitizing)
- Joint displays
- Narrative weaving
- Contiguous analysis

---

## Validity and Reliability

**Quantitative Research:**

**Internal Validity:**
- Control for confounding variables
- Random assignment
- Blinding
- Matching

**External Validity:**
- Representative sampling
- Replication studies
- Generalizability claims

**Construct Validity:**
- Operational definitions
- Validated instruments
- Convergent/discriminant validity

**Reliability:**
- Test-retest reliability
- Inter-rater reliability
- Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha)

**Qualitative Research:**

**Credibility (Internal Validity):**
- Prolonged engagement
- Triangulation
- Member checking
- Peer debriefing
- Negative case analysis

**Transferability (External Validity):**
- Thick description
- Purposive sampling
- Contextual details

**Dependability (Reliability):**
- Audit trail
- Code-recode procedures
- Reflexive journaling

**Confirmability (Objectivity):**
- Triangulation
- Reflexivity
- Audit trail
- Bracketing (phenomenology)

## Ethical Considerations

**Common Requirements:**
- IRB/Ethics committee approval
- Informed consent
- Voluntary participation
- Right to withdraw
- Confidentiality/anonymity
- Secure data storage
- Reporting of findings

**Special Considerations:**
- Vulnerable populations
- Sensitive topics
- Power dynamics (researcher-participant)
- Dual roles (practitioner-researcher)
- Cultural sensitivity

## High-Level vs. Detailed Protocol

### High-Level Appropriate When:
- Early in thesis process (proposal stage)
- Will develop details with advisor guidance
- Exploring feasibility before committing
- University allows iterative methodology development
- Student wants overview before diving into specifics

### Detailed Protocol Appropriate When:
- Ready for implementation
- Need comprehensive plan for advisor review
- Want to identify potential challenges before starting
- University requires detailed methodology in proposal
- Student benefits from thorough planning
- Research involves complex procedures

**Both are valid approaches** - the choice depends on student's stage, preferences, and requirements.

## Guidelines for João

**When helping with methodology:**

1. **Always connect to research question** - "This approach helps answer your question because..."

2. **Explain trade-offs** - "This design gives you X benefit but has Y limitation"

3. **Contextualize to their thesis type** - Different types need different methodologies

4. **Consider feasibility** - Time, resources, access, skills

5. **Justify choices** - "Why is this appropriate for YOUR research?"

6. **Adapt to depth choice** - Respect student's preference for high-level or detailed

7. **Use examples from their field** - "In project management research, researchers often use..."

8. **Check understanding** - "Does this make sense for your study?"

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
❌ Generic methodology not tied to research question
❌ Overly complex design for the research question
❌ Methodological choice that doesn't fit thesis type
❌ Forcing detailed protocol on student who wants high-level
❌ Not explaining WHY methodological choices matter
