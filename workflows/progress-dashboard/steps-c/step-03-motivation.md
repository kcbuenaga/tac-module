- Acknowledge the grind
- Remind them they're over halfway

**Stage 4: Approaching Completion (15,000-22,000 words)**
- Final push
- Celebrate how far they've come
- Focus on finishing strong

**Stage 5: Final Stretch (22,000+ words)**
- Almost there!

## 2. Generate Personalized Motivational Message

Based on progress stage, create an encouraging message:

### For Stage 1 (Getting Started):

```
🌟 YOU'VE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP!

Starting is the hardest part, and you've done it.

Every thesis begins with a single word. You've written {wordCount} words -
that's {wordCount} more than you had yesterday.

Remember: Progress, not perfection. Keep writing.
```

### For Stage 2 (Early Progress):

```
🔥 MOMENTUM IS BUILDING!

You've written {wordCount:,} words across {chapterCount} chapters.
That's real, tangible progress!

The hardest part is staying consistent, and you're doing it.
Keep this momentum going - you're establishing the habits that will
carry you all the way to your defense.
```

### For Stage 3 (Mid-Journey):

```
💪 YOU'RE OVER HALFWAY THERE!

{wordCount:,} words written. That's significant work!

The middle of a thesis can feel like a grind, but look at what you've built.
{chapterCount} chapters - each one is a building block toward your degree.

You're closer to the finish line than the starting line. Keep going!
```

### For Stage 4 (Approaching Completion):

```
🎯 THE FINISH LINE IS IN SIGHT!

{wordCount:,} words - you're in the final stretch!

Most of your thesis is DONE. What remains is refinement and completion.
You've proven you can do this. Now finish strong.

Your future self will thank you for pushing through right now.
```

### For Stage 5 (Final Stretch):

```
🏆 YOU'RE ALMOST THERE!

{wordCount:,} words written. Your thesis is essentially complete!

This is the victory lap. Focus on:
- Final revisions
- Defense preparation
- Celebrating this massive achievement

You've built something substantial. Time to bring it home!
```

## 3. Celebrate Specific Achievements

If any notable milestones exist, call them out:

**Examples:**
- "🎉 You've collected {sourcesCollected} sources - that's a solid literature base!"
- "✨ {writingSessions} writing sessions completed - consistency is key!"
- "📚 {chaptersCompleted} chapters done - you're building your thesis one chapter at a time!"
- "🎓 Defense prep started - you're thinking ahead!"

---

## 4. Suggest Next Steps

Based on progress data and what's missing, suggest 2-3 actionable next steps:

**If early in writing:**
- "Start or continue your current chapter - aim for 500 words today"
- "Run /tac:dr-carla:writing-session for guided writing time"
- "Collect 3-5 more sources for your literature review"

**If mid-journey:**
- "Finish drafting your current chapter"
- "Review advisor feedback and make revisions"
- "Run /tac:patricia:literature-review to strengthen your research foundation"

**If approaching completion:**
- "Complete final draft of remaining chapters"
- "Run /tac:lara:defense-preparation to start defense prep"
- "Request final advisor review of complete draft"

**If in final stretch:**
- "Practice your defense presentation"
- "Finalize citations and bibliography"
- "Run /tac:export to create Word/PDF versions for submission"

## 5. Closing Encouragement

End with an encouraging message tailored to their journey:

**For all stages:**

```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Custom encouragement based on their specific progress}

Remember: Every researcher who has earned their degree went through
exactly what you're going through right now. You're on the right path.

Keep going. You've got this! 🎓

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Run /tac:progress-dashboard anytime to see your progress.

Next time you run this, I expect to see even more progress! 😊
```
