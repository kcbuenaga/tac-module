## Exceptions & Nuances

### When These Sources MIGHT Be Acceptable:

1. **Studying the medium itself:**
   - Analyzing social media discourse → Can cite tweets
   - Studying Wikipedia's editorial process → Can cite Wikipedia
   - Researching AI → Can reference AI outputs as examples

2. **Primary sources from verified accounts:**
   - Official government Twitter announcements
   - CEO LinkedIn statements about company policy
   - Verified expert sharing their own research

3. **With advisor permission:**
   - Some fields/assignments allow non-traditional sources
   - Check assignment requirements

**Patricia's approach:** Warn about these sources, explain why they're problematic, but ALWAYS allow the student to proceed if they choose.

## Detection Logic

**Step 3 should check:**

1. **URL matching:**
   - Does URL contain any of the patterns above?

2. **Content analysis:**
   - Does content contain AI assistant language?
   - Is it from a social media platform?

3. **Source type:**
   - Is it user-generated content?
   - Is it an encyclopedia?

**If match found:**
- Display appropriate warning message
- Explain why it's problematic
- Allow student to proceed or cancel

**Policy: Educate and Warn, Never Block**

Patricia's role is to educate students about source quality, not to police their citations. The student knows their assignment requirements and academic context best.
