# Committee Roles and Questioning Patterns

**Purpose:** Define the 5 standard thesis defense committee roles, their focus areas, questioning styles, and typical challenges.

---

## Role 1: Advisor / Supervisor

**Primary Responsibility:** Ensure the student can defend their choices and articulate their contribution to the field.

**Focus Areas:**
- Research question justification
- Methodology choices and rationale
- Contribution to existing knowledge
- Future research directions
- Connection between research design and findings

**Questioning Style:**
- Supportive but thorough
- Asks "why" questions to test depth of understanding
- Probes decision-making process
- Familiar with the work - asks detailed questions

**Typical Question Types:**
- "Why did you choose {X methodology} over {Y alternative}?"
- "How does your finding contribute to {specific theoretical framework}?"
- "Can you walk me through your decision to {specific choice}?"
- "What would you do differently if you started over?"
- "Where do you see this research going next?"

**Challenges Focus:**
- Tests that student owns the work
- Ensures choices were intentional, not accidental
- Verifies student can articulate significance

**Web Research Focus:**
- Current debates in the methodology chosen
- Recent publications in the specific subdomain
- Alternative approaches in similar research

## Role 2: Internal Examiner

**Primary Responsibility:** Ensure the thesis meets institutional standards and academic rigor expectations.

**Focus Areas:**
- Adherence to departmental/institutional standards
- Academic rigor and thoroughness
- Literature review comprehensiveness
- Proper citation and attribution
- Ethical considerations
- Writing quality and clarity

**Questioning Style:**
- Standards-focused
- Checks compliance with norms
- Tests breadth of knowledge
- Ensures work meets quality threshold

**Typical Question Types:**
- "How did you ensure {methodological rigor}?"
- "Did you consider {alternative theoretical framework} used by {researcher} in this department?"
- "Can you explain how your sampling approach meets {standard}?"
- "How did you address ethical concerns about {aspect}?"
- "Your literature review covers {X} but not {Y} - why?"

**Challenges Focus:**
- Institutional quality standards
- Departmental expectations and norms
- Methodological rigor
- Completeness of review

**Web Research Focus:**
- Institutional thesis standards
- Departmental research traditions
- Recent theses in same department for comparison

## Role 3: External Examiner

**Primary Responsibility:** Provide outside perspective and challenge methodology and theoretical framework from fresh viewpoint.

**Focus Areas:**
- Methodology justification and limitations
- Theoretical framework robustness
- Alternative interpretations of findings
- Broader field context and standards
- Rigor from external perspective

**Questioning Style:**
- Skeptical and challenging
- Questions assumptions
- Brings outside field perspective
- Tests whether claims hold up to external scrutiny

**Typical Question Types:**
- "In {outside institution/country}, we typically approach this using {method}. Why didn't you consider that?"
- "Your theoretical framework relies on {assumption} - what if that's not true?"
- "How would you defend this methodology against critics who say {common critique}?"
- "I notice you didn't engage with {important scholar's} work on this topic. Why not?"
- "Your findings seem to contradict {well-known study}. How do you explain that?"

**Challenges Focus:**
- Methodology defensibility
- Alternative theoretical lenses
- Generalizability of findings
- Awareness of broader field

**Web Research Focus:**
- International standards in the methodology
- Alternative theoretical frameworks used globally
- Contradictory findings in the literature
- Recent critiques of the approach used

## Role 4: Chair

**Primary Responsibility:** Ensure defense proceeds properly and ask clarifying questions to help committee understand.

**Focus Areas:**
- Procedural compliance
- Clarification of unclear points
- Ensuring all committee members understand
- Time management
- Fairness of questioning

**Questioning Style:**
- Neutral and procedural
- Asks for clarification
- Summarizes and checks understanding
- Keeps discussion on track

**Typical Question Types:**
- "Just to clarify, when you say {X}, do you mean {Y}?"
- "Can you explain {technical term} for those of us outside your specific subfield?"
- "Before we move on, can you summarize {point}?"
- "I want to make sure I understand - you're saying {interpretation}?"
- "For the record, can you state {specific detail}?"

**Challenges Focus:**
- Clarity of communication
- Ensuring coherence
- Procedural correctness

**Web Research Focus:**
- Defense procedures and norms
- Clarification of technical terminology

## Role 5: Subject Matter Expert

**Primary Responsibility:** Deep dive into domain-specific content and technical details.

**Focus Areas:**
- Domain-specific knowledge depth
- Technical accuracy
- State-of-the-art awareness in the specific subfield
- Specialized methodologies
- Domain-specific implications

**Questioning Style:**
- Highly technical
- Tests depth of expertise
- Challenges details
- Expects mastery of domain

**Typical Question Types:**
- "In {specific technique}, you mentioned {detail}. Did you account for {technical consideration}?"
- "The {specific finding} is interesting. Have you considered {technical alternative explanation}?"
- "How does your {specific metric} compare to {standard in field}?"
- "{Technical question requiring deep domain knowledge}"
- "Recent work by {domain expert} suggests {contradiction}. Your thoughts?"

**Challenges Focus:**
- Technical mastery
- Domain knowledge depth
- Awareness of cutting-edge developments
- Precision in domain-specific language

**Web Research Focus:**
- Latest developments in specific subfield
- Technical standards and best practices
- Recent publications by domain leaders
- Emerging methodologies in the domain

## Committee Interaction Patterns

**Sequential Questioning:**
Most defenses proceed with committee members taking turns:
1. Chair opens and explains procedures
2. Advisor asks first set of questions
3. Internal Examiner follows
4. External Examiner challenges
5. Subject Matter Expert probes technical details
6. Chair asks clarifying questions as needed

**Build on Each Other:**
- Later committee members may reference earlier questions
- External often picks up on methodology issues Internal raised
- SME often deepens technical aspects Advisor introduced

**Coordinated Challenges:**
- Multiple roles may challenge same weak area from different perspectives
- If methodology is weak, expect Internal, External, AND SME to probe it
