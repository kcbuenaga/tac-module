- Can they strengthen responses when challenged?

---

### 5. Knowledge Depth (0-2 points)

**2 points - Excellent:**
- Demonstrates mastery of domain
- Can discuss related work and alternatives
- Explains technical concepts clearly
- Connects findings to broader field
- Aware of current debates

**1 point - Adequate:**
- Adequate domain knowledge
- Familiar with related work but not deeply
- Can explain some technical aspects
- Some connections to broader field
- Limited awareness of debates

**0 points - Weak:**
- Surface-level understanding
- Unfamiliar with related work
- Struggles with technical explanations
- Cannot connect to broader field
- Unaware of current debates

**Assessment questions:**
- Does student demonstrate deep knowledge?
- Can they discuss alternatives and related work?
- Do they explain technical aspects clearly?
- Are they aware of field debates?

## Overall Readiness Interpretation

**Total Score: 0-10**

### 10 points - Defense-Ready (Exceptional)
- Ready to defend immediately
- All areas strong
- Minimal risk of issues
- Confident and well-prepared

### 8-9 points - Defense-Ready (Strong)
- Ready to defend with minor polish
- Most areas strong
- Low risk of significant issues
- Well-prepared overall

### 6-7 points - Approaching Readiness
- Not quite defense-ready yet
- Some areas need strengthening
- Moderate risk if defended now
- 1-2 more practice sessions recommended
- Focus on specific weak areas

### 4-5 points - Making Progress
- Significant work still needed
- Multiple areas need improvement
- High risk if defended now
- Several more practice sessions needed
- Targeted work on weaknesses required

### 0-3 points - Not Ready
- Not ready for defense
- Fundamental issues across multiple areas
- Very high risk if defended now
- Extensive practice needed
- Consider delaying defense

## Progress Tracking

### Session-to-Session Comparison

**Improving (Positive Trend):**
- Score increased by 1+ points
- Fewer logic gaps identified
- Faster response times
- Better handling of probing
- Weak areas being addressed

**Stagnant (No Change):**
- Score within 0.5 points
- Same number of logic gaps
- No improvement in response quality
- Weak areas persist
- Not addressing feedback

**Declining (Negative Trend):**
- Score decreased by 1+ points
- More logic gaps identified
- Slower or less confident responses
- Weaker responses than before
- New weak areas emerging

---

## Weak Areas Tracking

**Common Weak Areas:**
- Methodology justification
- Theoretical framework clarity
- Literature review gaps
- Findings interpretation
- Limitations acknowledgment
- Alternative explanations
- Technical details
- Broader implications
- Future research directions

**Track for each session:**
- Which areas remain weak
- Which areas improved
- Which new areas emerged as weak
- Specific questions that exposed weaknesses

---

## Committee Role Tracking

**Track which roles consistently find gaps:**

**Example patterns:**
- External Examiner consistently challenges methodology
  → Methodology is a weak area needing work

- Subject Matter Expert repeatedly probes technical details
  → Technical mastery is insufficient

- Internal Examiner questions thoroughness
  → Literature review or rigor needs strengthening

**Use this data to:**
- Focus practice sessions on problematic roles
- Identify systemic weaknesses
- Target preparation efforts

---

## Question Flagging

**Flag questions for more practice when:**
- Student cannot answer on first attempt
- Response requires multiple rounds of probing
- Logic gaps identified in response
- Student shows uncertainty or hesitation
- Response quality is weak

**Flagged questions should:**
- Be practiced again in next session
- Be tracked until answered well consistently
- Indicate specific areas needing study

---

## Feedback Tone Adaptation

**Session 1 (Baseline):**
- Be harsh and critical
- Identify every weakness
- Set realistic expectations
- "You're not ready. Here's why..."

**Sessions 2-3 (Progress Monitoring):**
- Acknowledge improvements specifically
- Continue being critical of weaknesses
- "Better on X, but Y still needs work..."

**Sessions 4+ (Readiness Assessment):**
- If improving: Measured encouragement
- If stagnant: Direct concern
- "You're getting close..." OR "No progress on X..."

**High Score (8+):**
- Honest acknowledgment of readiness
- Not cheerful, but positive
- "You're defense-ready. Here are minor points..."

---

## Special Considerations

**First-time Defenders:**
- May need more sessions (4-6)
- Expect slower initial progress
- Build confidence gradually

**Language Barriers:**
- Response time may be slower
- Focus on clarity over speed
- Allow extra time for responses

**Interdisciplinary Work:**
- May struggle with multiple committee perspectives
- Need extra preparation for each lens
- Practice translating across domains

**Novel Methods:**
- Expect strong methodology challenges
- Practice defending innovation
- Prepare alternative justifications

---

**Use this rubric to:**
1. Score each practice session objectively
2. Track progress across sessions
3. Identify specific areas needing work
4. Determine overall defense readiness
5. Adapt feedback tone appropriately
