## Dimensions for Varying Questions

### Scope Variations

**Narrow Scope:**
- Specific industry or sector
- Single organization or small sample
- Limited timeframe
- Particular geographic region
- Defined stakeholder group

**Example:** "How do middle managers in German automotive companies perceive digital transformation initiatives?" (Narrow: German, automotive, middle managers)

**Broad Scope:**
- Multiple industries or sectors
- Large sample or population
- Extended timeframe
- Multiple regions or global
- Diverse stakeholder groups

**Example:** "How do managers across European industries perceive digital transformation?" (Broad: Europe-wide, multiple industries)

### Focus Variations

**Process Focus:** HOW something occurs
- "How do organizations implement..."
- "What processes lead to..."

**Outcome Focus:** WHAT results emerge
- "What are the outcomes of..."
- "To what extent does... achieve..."

**Perception Focus:** HOW stakeholders view or experience
- "How do employees perceive..."
- "What are managers' attitudes toward..."

**Relationship Focus:** Connections between variables
- "What is the relationship between..."
- "How does X influence Y..."

### Context Variations

- **Industry context:** Healthcare, finance, manufacturing, technology, etc.
- **Organization type:** Startups, SMEs, multinationals, non-profits, public sector
- **Geographic context:** Country, region, global, developed vs. emerging markets
- **Temporal context:** Current state, historical evolution, future trends
- **Stakeholder context:** Employees, managers, customers, investors, regulators

## MBA Thesis Considerations

### Time Constraints (3-6 months typical)
**Prefer:**
- Focused scope (1-2 industries or cases)
- Accessible data (surveys, interviews within network)
- Established theoretical frameworks
- Clear boundaries (specific timeframe, geography)

**Avoid:**
- Longitudinal studies requiring years of data
- Large-scale quantitative studies (unless data readily available)
- Multiple complex research questions
- Overly broad or ambiguous scope

### Data Accessibility
**Feasible:**
- Surveys of professionals in your network
- Interviews with 10-20 participants
- Case studies of 2-5 organizations
- Secondary data analysis (public datasets)
- Content analysis of documents/websites

**Challenging:**
- Access to senior executives or multiple organizations
- Proprietary company data
- Large random samples
- Experimental designs requiring interventions

### Contribution Requirements
**Strong contributions:**
- Novel context (new industry, geography, or application)
- Timely topic (emerging trends, recent changes)
- Practical implications for managers
- Extension or challenge to existing theory
- Integration of multiple perspectives

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Too Broad
❌ "What are the factors affecting organizational performance?"
✅ "What are the key factors affecting innovation performance in European fintech startups?"

### Too Narrow
❌ "How does the CEO of Company X view digital strategy?"
✅ "How do CEOs of mid-sized manufacturing firms view digital transformation strategies?"

### Not Researchable in Timeframe
❌ "How has organizational culture evolved in the tech industry over the past 30 years?"
✅ "How do tech startups establish organizational culture during their first 3 years?"

### Ambiguous Terms
❌ "What is the impact of good leadership on success?"
✅ "How do transformational leadership behaviors influence innovation performance in R&D teams?"

### Normative/Opinion-Based
❌ "Should companies adopt remote work policies?"
✅ "What factors influence companies' decisions to adopt permanent remote work policies?"

## Generating Alternatives: Practical Guide

### Step 1: Identify the Core Elements
From the draft question, extract:
- **Topic:** What is being studied?
- **Context:** Where/when/who?
- **Focus:** What aspect or relationship?
- **Scope:** How broad or narrow?

### Step 2: Vary One Dimension at a Time
**Alternative 1:** Change the scope (narrow or broaden)
**Alternative 2:** Change the focus (process → outcome, or perception → relationship)
**Alternative 3:** Change the context (different industry, stakeholder, or geography)
**Alternative 4:** Change the question type (exploratory → explanatory → evaluative)
**Alternative 5:** Combine multiple variations

### Step 3: Check Each Alternative
- [ ] Clear and unambiguous?
- [ ] Researchable within MBA thesis constraints?
- [ ] Distinct from other alternatives (not just word changes)?
- [ ] Maintains connection to student's original topic interest?
- [ ] Has clear scope boundaries (IN and OUT)?
- [ ] Appropriate for student's field and methodology preferences?
