# Research Question Evaluation Criteria

**Purpose:** Framework for evaluating research question quality using established research methodology principles.

---

## The Three Core Criteria

### 1. Researchability

**Definition:** The question can be answered using available research methods, resources, and within the constraints of an MBA thesis.

#### Sub-Criteria

**Data Accessibility**
- Can the required data be obtained?
- What sources exist (primary data, secondary data, existing datasets)?
- Are there access barriers (confidentiality, cost, geographic distance)?
- Can you reach necessary participants or cases?

**Methodological Feasibility**
- What research methods would be appropriate?
- Qualitative (interviews, case studies, ethnography)?
- Quantitative (surveys, experiments, statistical analysis)?
- Mixed methods?
- Are these methods within your capability?
- Do you have or can you acquire necessary skills?

**Resource Constraints**
- Time: Can this be completed in 3-6 months?
- Budget: Are there significant costs (software, travel, participant incentives)?
- Access: Do you need special permissions or approvals?
- Skills: Can you learn necessary methods or tools?

**Ethical Considerations**
- Are there ethical concerns (sensitive topics, vulnerable populations)?
- Would this require ethics approval?
- How complex is the approval process?

#### Assessment Levels

**Strong Researchability:**
- Clear data sources with confirmed access
- Appropriate methods within current capabilities
- Realistic timeframe for completion
- No significant resource or ethical barriers
- Precedent of similar studies in literature

**Moderate Researchability:**
- Data sources identified but access uncertain
- Methods available but may require skill development
- Tight but manageable timeframe
- Some resource constraints but workarounds exist
- Limited precedent but theoretically sound

**Weak Researchability:**
- Data sources unclear or access unlikely
- Methods beyond current capabilities
- Unrealistic timeframe
- Significant resource or ethical barriers
- No precedent and methodological challenges

#### Red Flags
❌ "Access to data depends on permission from multiple organizations"
❌ "Requires longitudinal data collection over 2+ years"
❌ "Need specialized equipment or expensive software"
❌ "Population is difficult to reach or unwilling to participate"
❌ "Requires advanced statistical techniques you haven't learned"

### 2. Scope Appropriateness

**Definition:** The question is neither too broad nor too narrow for an MBA thesis, with clear boundaries that enable depth while remaining feasible.

#### Sub-Criteria

**Breadth vs. Depth**
- Broad enough to demonstrate substantial research
- Narrow enough to achieve depth and insight
- Balances comprehensiveness with focus

**Clear Boundaries**
- Well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Specific context (industry, geography, timeframe)
- Limited number of variables or dimensions
- Realistic sample size or case selection

**Thesis-Level Appropriateness**
- Substantial enough for master's degree level
- Not undergraduate-level simplicity
- Not doctoral-level complexity
- Appropriate theoretical engagement

**Time-to-Completion**
- Literature review feasible in available time
- Data collection achievable within semester/term
- Analysis and write-up realistic
- Buffer for revisions and unexpected challenges

#### Assessment Levels

**Well-Scoped:**
- Focused on specific context (industry, geography, organization type)
- Limited to 1-3 key concepts or relationships
- Clear boundaries (IN/OUT) that make sense
- Achievable sample size (10-20 interviews, 50-200 survey responses, 2-5 cases)
- Precedent of similar-scope theses

**Moderately Scoped:**
- Somewhat broad but could be narrowed through research design
- Multiple contexts but manageable
- Boundaries exist but could be clearer
- Ambitious but not impossible
- May need to adjust scope during research

**Poorly Scoped:**
- Too broad: multiple industries, countries, timeframes, concepts
- Too narrow: single case study of unique situation with limited transferability
- Unclear boundaries or open-ended exploration
- Unrealistic sample requirements
- No clear stopping point for data collection

#### Red Flags - Too Broad
❌ "Organizational performance across all industries globally"
❌ "Digital transformation in Europe"
❌ "Factors affecting innovation" (no context, no limits)
❌ "30-year historical analysis of leadership trends"

#### Red Flags - Too Narrow
❌ "Decision-making process of the CEO of Company X"
❌ "Social media strategy of a single startup"
❌ "Implementation of one specific software in one department"

#### Well-Scoped Examples
✅ "Digital transformation strategies in mid-sized German manufacturing firms (2020-2025)"
✅ "Leadership practices that support innovation in European fintech startups"
✅ "Sustainability adoption challenges in family-owned SMEs in the food industry"

### 3. Contribution to Knowledge

**Definition:** The question addresses a gap in knowledge and will produce findings that add value to academic literature and/or managerial practice.

#### Sub-Criteria

**Novelty**
- **Context:** New industry, geography, or organizational type
- **Phenomenon:** Emerging or under-researched topic
- **Perspective:** New lens or theoretical framing
- **Time:** Current/recent developments not yet studied
- **Integration:** Combines concepts not previously linked

**Theoretical Contribution**
- Tests, extends, or challenges existing theory
- Applies theory to new context
- Identifies boundary conditions
- Reveals unexpected relationships
- Builds new conceptual framework

**Practical Relevance**
- Addresses real problems managers face
- Provides actionable insights
- Informs decision-making
- Improves organizational practices
- Has clear stakeholder value

**Timeliness**
- Responds to current trends or changes
- Addresses recent developments
- Relevant to contemporary debates
- Fills emerging knowledge gaps

#### Assessment Levels

**Strong Contribution:**
- Clear novelty (new context, phenomenon, or perspective)
- Addresses recognized gap in literature
- High practical relevance to managers
- Timely and current topic
- Potential for publication or industry interest
- Both theoretical and practical implications

**Moderate Contribution:**
- Incremental advance on existing research
- Applies known concepts to somewhat new context
- Some practical relevance
- Replicates or extends prior findings
- Specific to particular setting but limited transferability

**Weak Contribution:**
- Well-established topic with extensive literature
- No clear novelty or gap addressed
- Limited practical implications
- Primarily descriptive without explanation
- Findings likely to confirm what's already known

#### Types of Contribution

**1. Novel Context**
- First study in specific industry/geography
- *Example:* "First study of gig economy platforms in Southeast Asia"

**2. Emerging Phenomenon**
- Recent trend or development
- *Example:* "Post-pandemic remote work policies in traditional sectors"

**3. Theoretical Extension**
- Applying theory to new domain
- *Example:* "Resource-based view applied to social enterprises"

**4. Integration**
- Combining multiple perspectives
- *Example:* "Linking organizational culture to digital transformation outcomes"

**5. Challenging Assumptions**
- Testing conventional wisdom
- *Example:* "When does agile methodology NOT improve project success?"

**6. Stakeholder Perspective**
- Under-represented voices
- *Example:* "Middle managers' experience of change initiatives" (vs. executive view)

**7. Comparative Insight**
- Contrasting contexts or approaches
- *Example:* "Incumbent vs. startup approaches to sustainability"

#### Red Flags - Weak Contribution
❌ "Factors affecting job satisfaction" (extensively researched, no novel angle)
❌ "Benefits of good leadership" (too general, known topic)
❌ "Description of Company X's strategy" (case study with no transferability)
❌ "Replicating a 2010 study with no new context or perspective"

#### Strong Contribution Examples
✅ "Post-COVID remote work challenges in industries traditionally requiring physical presence"
✅ "AI adoption barriers in family-owned SMEs" (under-researched context)
✅ "Paradoxes of sustainability: when environmental goals conflict with social goals"

## Applying the Criteria

### Step-by-Step Evaluation Process

**Step 1: Assess Researchability**
1. Identify data sources needed
2. Check access and feasibility
3. Determine appropriate methods
4. Estimate time and resources required
5. Identify potential blockers

**Step 2: Assess Scope**
1. Define clear boundaries (IN/OUT)
2. Check breadth vs. depth balance
3. Estimate sample size or case requirements
4. Validate against thesis-level expectations
5. Compare to precedent theses

**Step 3: Assess Contribution**
1. Identify the novelty angle (context, phenomenon, perspective, etc.)
2. Check literature for gaps or under-researched areas
3. Determine theoretical contribution potential
4. Assess practical relevance and implications
5. Evaluate timeliness and current relevance

### Making Trade-Offs

**Perfect questions are rare.** Most questions involve trade-offs:

**Example Trade-Off 1: Breadth vs. Researchability**
- Broader question = stronger contribution potential
- Narrower question = more researchable
- **Resolution:** Choose narrow enough to complete, broad enough for contribution

**Example Trade-Off 2: Novelty vs. Risk**
- Novel contexts = higher contribution, less guidance from literature
- Established contexts = clearer path, incremental contribution
- **Resolution:** Balance novelty with precedent and feasibility

**Example Trade-Off 3: Practical vs. Theoretical**
- Highly practical = stakeholder interest, limited theoretical depth
- Highly theoretical = academic contribution, may lack practical relevance
- **Resolution:** Aim for both (theoretical framework applied to practical problem)

### Overall Assessment

After evaluating all three criteria, synthesize:

**All Strong:** Excellent research question, proceed with confidence
**Mix of Strong/Moderate:** Good research question, minor adjustments may help
**Any Weak:** Reconsider question or address weakness before proceeding
**Multiple Weak:** Consider regenerating alternatives

**Decision Heuristic:**
- **Researchability is CRITICAL** - cannot proceed if data/methods unavailable
- **Scope can be adjusted** - easier to narrow or refine than other criteria
- **Contribution should be clear** - if weak, question value of research
